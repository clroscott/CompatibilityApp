A data-driven compatibility engine for analyzing real-world couples.

This compatability app is an experimental app designed to estimate the long-term success likelihood of romantic partnerships using behavioral science, downward social comparison pattern analysis & relationship psychology research.

Built with love (and rigorous methodology) by Mikaela & Clyaton, this project combines statistical modeling with modern web app development to provide couples with personalized insights — or in our words:

“Math, but make it romantic.”
